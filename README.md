# Retail-Camping-Store-website
I have been asked to help develop a new website for a new camping equipment retailer  that is moving to online sales (RCC – Retail Camping Company). 

The Retail Camping Company has the following basic requirements for the contents of the 
website:

• Home Page: 
   o This page will introduce visitors to the special offers that are available and it should include relevant images of camping equipment such as tents,   cookers 
and camping gear such as furniture and cookware.
   o The text should be minimal, visuals should be used to break up the written content.
   o This page should include a navigation bar (with links inside the bar and hover over tabs), slide show, header, sections, footer.
   o Modal pop-up window that is displayed on top of the current page.
   
• Camping Equipment: This page will provide a catalogue of products that are on sale such as tents, camping equipment and cookware.

• Furniture: This page should give customers a catalogue of camping furniture that is on sale.

• Reviews: This page should include a forum where the registered members can review the products they have purchased.

• Basket: This page should allow the customers to add camping equipment to their basket which is saved and checked out later.

• Offers and Packages: This page provides a catalogue of the most popular equipment that is sold
